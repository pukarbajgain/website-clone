                    <h3>Armenia: A Land of Century Long and Rich History</h3>
                    <p>Armenian Highland <br>Armenians are one of the ancient nations in Western Asia, formed within the
                        territory of Armenian
                        Highland encompassing a large area between Anti-Taurus and eastern slopes of Artsakh Mountain
                        (Karabagh Highland), i.e. between the mountains of Armenian Taurus and East-Pontic, Trialet and
                        Mosk. Armenian plateau occupies approximately 360 thousands sq km. In the center of the Upland
                        stands Biblical Mount Ararat (Masis, 5165). Mount Aragats (4090 meters) is the highest peak of
                        the current Armenian Republic. The climate here is severely continental – with harsh winters and
                        stuffy summers. The flora and fauna of Armenian Highland are rich.</p>
                    <p>The Formation of Armenian Nation <br>
                        Armenian Highland was firstly inhabited as soon as at the Stone Age (Paleolithic era). Due to
                        its rich mineral resources Armenia very soon became not only a large metallurgical center but
                        also copper, bronze, gold and silver exporter. At the age of rapid development of bronze
                        industry and iron adoption (at the turn of II-I millenniums BC) class relations and tribal
                        unions were formed among the tribes of the Armenian tableland. These processes created
                        preconditions for state emergence. Hayasa-Azzi, Isuva, Alishe, Uruatri, Dayaeni, Diauekhi, the
                        little centers of statehood emergence, which are known from Hittie, Assyrian and other sources
                        were the first tribal unions living in the Armenian Plateau. The process of formation of
                        Armenian nation mostly dated to the II-I millenniums BC. This circumstance makes it almost
                        impossible to clearly and thoroughly illustrate all the details of its origin. There is no doubt
                        that the process took place in the Armenian plateau through the gradual merger of different
                        tribes into Armenian. Some researchers highlight the leading role of Hayasa tribal union in this
                        process, most probably it served as the origin for the denomination of Armenian nation – “hay”
                    </p>
                    <p>The Kingdom of Van or Urartu <br>
                        According to historians, the ancient Armenian united state was Ayrarat Kingdom of Haykyans. In
                        the IX century BC Ayrarat kingdom suffered several defeats in the fight against strengthening
                        Assyrians and became weaker. Another tribal union became mighty enough to gradually acquire
                        political supremacy. The Assyrians called this new kingdom Urartu after the name of the Ayrarat
                        Kingdom. However, in the inscriptions of local kings it was called Biaynali or Biayneli and
                        Shureli, which corresponds to the now accepted name - Kingdom of Van. In the XIII-IX centuries
                        BC the Kingdom of Van significantly expanded its borders becoming one of the most powerful
                        states in Western Asia under Menuas, Argistis and Sardur II. During this period economy, crafts,
                        urban life and culture rapidly developed and well-known Urartean cuneiform was created. However,
                        new reinforcement of Assyria and its victorious wars against the Kingdom of Van, invasion of
                        Cimmerian and Scythian tribes, formation of the Median kingdom led to the fall of the kingdom of
                        Van at the beginning of the VI century BC (the last decades of the VII century BC are also
                        possible).</p>

                    <p>Eruandids’ Kingdom <br>
                        According to recent studies, a Scythian leader Partatu or Paruir (according to Armenian sources)
                        had been proclaimed as a king of Armenia by the end of the VII century BC. A number of
                        principalities were formed on the ruins of the Kingdom of Van. The kingdom of Paruir (Scythian
                        name Partatuna) was distinguished among them but it was not destined to exist for a long time.
                        The country was united into one kingdom only under Eruandid royal dynasty in the face of king
                        Aramani, erroneously referred to as Aram by the father of Armenian historiography Moses
                        Khorenatsi. Using the political vacuum created as a result of the struggle between Assyria from
                        the one side and the Chaldeans of Babylonia and Median Kingdom from the other, the Armenian king
                        extended the borders of his state. Armenian Eruandid kings continued to rule in Armenia,
                        sometimes combining the office of the Persian satraps or being under their domination. After the
                        defeat of the Achaemenid Empire by Alexander the Great at the battle of Gaugamela, Armenia
                        regained its independence (the capital was Ervandashat). On one of the Greek inscriptions of
                        that era that was found in Armavir is written: ''A beautiful country of Armenia!''. However, the
                        Seleucid state, formed on the ruins of Alexander the Great’s empire, spread its dominance over
                        Armenia for a short time.</p>

                    <p>Armenia under Artashesids: Tigranes the Great <br>
                        After the decisive defeat of the Seleucid army at Magnesia (190 BC) Greater Armenia (Mets Hayk)
                        and Tsopk regained their independence. The founder of the Artashesids dynasty Artaxias I
                        (189-160 BC), as a result of several successful wars, expanded the boundaries of Greater
                        Armenia, making it a strong state. Artsakh, Syunik and Utik constituted the integral parts of
                        Artashes’ kingdom. Thus, he succeeded in merging the borders of Greater Armenia (except Tsopk).
                        Under Tigranes the Great (Tigranes II - 95-55 BC) the kingdom of Greater Armenia became a
                        powerful empire of Western Asia, reaching the zenith of its political power. Basically
                        completing the unification of the Armenian lands, including Tsopk, Tigran II expanded the
                        boundaries of Greater Armenia, as a result of victorious conquest wars, and relying on alliance
                        with Kingdom of Pontus. He annexed Atropatene, Seleucid Syria, Kommagenu, Cilicia, Mesopotamia,
                        etc. In the first years of his reign Tigranes concluded military-political alliance with the
                        king of Pontius Mithridates for supporting and backing each other, as well as for a joint
                        struggle against Rome in the East. The supremacy of the Armenian king was recognized not only by
                        Judah, Nabataea, Iberian and Caucasian Albanian kingdoms, but also by the Parthian state.
                        Tigranes II became allies with the Arabic and other Central Asian tribes of the Persian Gulf.
                        Under Artashesids the Hellenic cultural influence increased in Armenia. Architecture,
                        literature, poetry, historiography, and theater experienced an unprecedented progress.
                        Nevertheless, the expansion of Rome put an end to the power of Greater Armenia, reaching to its
                        zenith. Discomfiting Mithridates, the closest ally of Tigranes, the Roman general Lucullus
                        invaded Armenia in spring, 69 BC, but could not force Armenia to finally knee. According to the
                        decision of the Roman Senate, Pompey substituted Lucullus in 66 BC and once again attacked
                        Armenia, moving toward the capital Artashat. Tigranes was forced to offer peace to Pompey.
                        According to the Armenian-Roman Artashat treaty of 66 BC Armenian kingdom lost much of the
                        conquered lands, but continued to remain a strong country in the region. Further Artavazdes II
                        and Artaxias II attempted to restore its former power. Artavazdes was a statesman who got
                        brilliant Hellenic education at the Armenian royal court. He staged performances, wrote speeches
                        and dramas. Artavazdes’ skillful policy of maneuvering between belligerent Rome and Parthia
                        constituted a reliable guarantee of independence and national security. In 34 BC Artavazdes was
                        captured by Roman general Antony, who invaded Armenia and taken to Egypt with his family, where
                        a victory parade was organized with participation of Queen Cleopatra. In the second half of the
                        1st century AD thanks to a successful battle of the Armenian-Parthian allied forces against
                        Rome, Tiridates I took the throne of the kingdom of Greater Armenia. After the defeat of the
                        Romans at the battle of Randi (62 AD), Trdat I went to Rome, was crowned by Emperor Nero and
                        returned to Armenia (65-66 AD). Trdat used the money given by Nero in compensation for the
                        destruction of Artashat by the Romans, to restore the capital and to build the Sun Temple of
                        Garni. Arshakids’ dynasty (a cadet branch of Parthian Arshakids) was established in Greater
                        Armenia.</p>

                    <p>Armenia under the Arshakids Dynasty <br>The enthronement of Tiridates I (66-88) gave start to the
                        dominion of the cadet branch of Arshakids in Greater Armenia (Mets Hayk). In the 3rd and 4th
                        centuries, as a result of socio-economic changes, the kingdom of Greater Armenia gradually
                        turned into a feudal monarchy. At the end of the 3rd century and at the beginning of the 4th
                        century Christian communities had already formed in nearly the entire territory of the kingdom.
                        According to tradition, the first preachers of Christianity in Armenia were St. Thaddeus and St.
                        Bartholomew apostles. In 301, under Tiridates III (286-330) Armenia became the first country
                        that proclaimed Christianity as a state religion. St. Gregory the Illuminator was consecrated
                        the first patriarch of the Armenian Apostolic Church. Hard struggle against Roman and Sassanid
                        Persia weakened Armenian kingdom, which was later divided between the two above mentioned
                        states. Thus in 428, the Armenian kingdom was dissolved by the Persian court and turned into
                        Мarzpanate (province).</p>

                    <p>Invention of the Armenian Alphabet <br>
                        Perfectly acknowledging the whole danger of the current situation for both the country and the
                        people, under the patronage of the king Bahram Shapur and patriarch of Armenia Isaac Partev,
                        Mesrop Mashtots invented Armenian alphabet in 405, which became a powerful weapon for preserving
                        the Armenian national identity. Invention of the Armenian alphabet ushered in a new era in
                        Armenian culture, science and literature. Translations and independent literary heritage created
                        in Mesrop’s alphabet was so rich and complete that the 5th century became the "Golden Age" in
                        the history of Armenian culture.</p>

                        Nagorno-Karabakh Republic <br>
                        On September 2, 1991 the joint session of both Nagorno Karabakh regional and Shahoumian district
                        councils of parliamentarians declared the independence of Nagorno- Karabakh Republic within the
                        borders of former Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Region and Shoumian. The declaration of
                        independence of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic (NKR) was adopted. Thus, the right determined by
                        then enacted legislation- the law of the Soviet Union from April 3, 1990 on the order of
                        withdrawal of Union republics from the USSR- was implemented. It provided national autonomies
                        with a right to freely determine their legal status, in the case of withdrawal of Union republic
                        from the USSR. On December 10, 1991 only a few days before the official collapse of the Soviet
                        Union, a referendum took place in Nagorno Karabakh according to which the vast majority of
                        native population voted in favor of full independence from Azerbaijan. This was followed by
                        parliamentary elections where the Parliament of the NKR was elected, which in its turn formed
                        the first government. The government of independent NKR took over its commitments under the
                        conditions of total blockage and subsequent military aggression of Azerbaijan. Making use of the
                        4th USSR Army ammunitions and weapons deployed on its territory, Azerbaijan unleashed a
                        full-scale military action against Nagorno Karabakh. The warfare continued with changing success
                        from the fall of 1991 to May 1994 when with the mediation of the Russian Federation, Kyrgyzystan
                        and the Inter-Parliamentary Assembly of the CIS, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh
                        Republic signed the cease-fire agreement in Bishkek which is in force up to date. As a result of
                        war, unleashed by Azerbaijan the people of Nagorno Karabakh confirmed its natural right to live
                        freely. Starting from September 2007 Bako Sahakian is the elected president of the Republic of
                        Nagorno-Karabakh. The Constitution of NKR is in force since 2006. In 1992 with the aim of
                        resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict the Minks Conference of the CSCE was established. Within
                        the frameworks of the latter negotiation process is going on up to date by the OSCE Minsk Group
                        Co-Chairmanship, which is to gain a final resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict and
                        determine its final status.
