                            The Hayastan All-Armenian Fund was founded by Presidential Decree in 1992. It is a unique
                            institution whose mission is to unite Armenians in Armenia and overseas to overcome the
                            country’s difficulties and to help establish sustainable development in Armenia and Artsakh.

                        <p>
                            The local affiliates closely cooperate with representatives of church, non-governmental and

                        <p>
                            The funds’ financial resources are obtained through a variety of fundraising activities
                            including annual telethons, phoneathons, radiothons, benefit bike rides, gala dinners,
                            concerts,

                            Since 1996, every year the annual Telethon, broadcast from Los Angeles, reports on global
                            fundraising totals for the year, familiarizes supporters with newly completed and ongoing
                            projects, and rallies the worldwide Armenian community around an overarching development
                            objective. Amounts raised at the Telethon are directed to the implementation of an
                            comprehensive
                            strategic project approved b ythe Board of Trustees.

                            The European Phoneathon, spearheaded by the fund’s French affiliate, reaches Armenian
                            supporters
                            across France, Germany, Switzerland, Holland and Greece, securing donations for a given
                            year’s
                            strategic objective. Phoneathons are also conducted in Argentina and Uruguay.
                            The fund’s accomplishments to date comprise a broad range of initiatives that are of vital
                            importance to our homeland. They include the construction or renovation of roads, schools,
                            kindergartens, hospitals, and water and gas networks, as well as assistance to socially
                            vulnerable groups such as families of disabled or deceased veterans of Artsakh’s war of
                            liberation, students from disadvantaged families. Today the generous support of the
                            worldwide
                            Armenian community continues to help improve the lives of thousands in Armenia and Artsakh
                            by
                            securing housing, water, heating, and other core necessities. The fund is also a major
                            supporter
                            of science and the visual arts, promoting the work of outstanding artists, intellectuals,
                            and
                            scientists as well as gifted youths. The Fund’s first major initiative was the Winter
                            Humanitarian Project, which alleviated pressing social needs in 1992-95. At the same time
                            the
                            Fund initiated a house-building program following the Spitak 1988 earthquake: providing
                            accommodation to those left without shelter in Gyumri, Vanadzor, Stepanavan and Spitak.
                            Since
                            1995, the Fund has been providing a continuing financial assistance to needy students and
                            families of deceased and invalided soldiers of the Artsakh conflict.

                        <p>
                            In 1995-99, the Fund was entrusted with implementing major infrastructure development
                            projects,
                            as a result of which it constructed the major Goris-Stepanakert highway. In 2001, it
                            financed
                            the construction of the North-South Highway. This established a road network between cities
                            and
                            villages in Nagorno Karabakh and greatly contributed to economic growth in the country. With
                            the
                            completion of these strategically important roads, the Fund successfully implemented two
                            major
                            projects of regional significance.

                        <p>
                            In parallel with road building, the Fund has embarked on community development projects
                            including the construction and renovation of schools, hospitals, water treatment and supply
                            systems, power transmission lines and cultural canters.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In 2005, the Board of Trustees approved the Artsakh Rebirth territorial development project,
                            which opened a new page in the Fund’s activities. The Board unanimously decided to use funds
                            raised in the 2005 and 2006 telethons to revitalize and develop the Nagorno Karabakh regions
                            of
                            Martakert and Hadrut, which had particularly suffered during the Artsakh conflict. In 2006,
                            several projects were initiated in Martakert including support to agriculture, water supply,
                            healthcare, and school building. A similar project is being carried out in Hadrut and
                            Martuni
                            regions.

                            During the years of its activity, Hayastan Fund has gained widespread respect and
                            recognition
                            for successfully meeting the needs and aspirations of the time. Always a great support to
                            Armenia, the Fund is committed to its mission of successfully and steadily developing the
                            young
