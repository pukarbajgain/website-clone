        <p>The Armenian Theatre has history of more than 2000 years. In the Matenadaran there are a lot of manuscripts also about the theatre. The Greek historian Plutarch attests, that in 53 B.C. “The Bacchae” of Euripides was staged in Artashat and that the Armenian king Artavazd composed tragedies. The chronicler of the 5th century Hovhan Mandakouni and Davtak Kertogh /7th century/, then Tovma Artsruni /9th-10th centuries/ and others gave valuable information on the Theatre, according to which, the Theatre maintained its existence in further centuries, too. The traditions of the Armenian Theatre are being kept with zeal and responsibility also today.</p>
